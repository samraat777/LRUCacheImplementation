# LRUCacheImplementation
Simple LRU Cache Implementation in Java
LRU stands for least recently used cache/memory.
Since we know we have limited cache memory in our computers, so there is need of storing only relevant and most recent page and eliminating the least recently used according
to time stamp. For this we use two data structure one doubly ended queue/ doubly linked list and other hash.
